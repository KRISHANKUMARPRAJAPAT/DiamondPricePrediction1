# Diamond Price Prediction End to End Project

# Overview:

This project aims to build a robust machine learning pipeline for predicting the price of diamonds based on their various features and characteristics. By leveraging a comprehensive dataset that includes information such as carat weight, cut quality, color, clarity, and dimensions, GemExquisite's data science team will develop an accurate and reliable diamond price prediction model.
The pipeline encompasses data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation stages. By employing machine learning algorithms and leveraging data-driven insights, the team aims to provide real-time pricing estimates for diamonds based on their unique attributes. 

# Objectives:
Develop and deploy a diamond price prediction model to accurately estimate the price of diamonds. Enhance customer satisfaction by providing fair and transparent pricing information. Enable sales representatives to provide real-time pricing estimates to customers.

**This pipeline is divided in two main steps: data preprocessing and model training pipelines (both inside kpr/pipelines)
